Here are some additional things to keep in mind when planning your trip to Kashmir:
The best time to visit Kashmir is during the summer (June-September), when the weather is warm and sunny.
The monsoon season (July-August) can be wet and humid, but it is also a beautiful time to visit, as the mountains are lush and green.
The winter (December-February) can be cold and snowy, but it is also a great time to visit if you are looking for some winter sports.
Be sure to pack warm clothes, regardless of when you visit Kashmir. The weather can change quickly, and it can get cold even in the summer.
Be aware of the security situation in Kashmir before you travel. The region has been a hotbed of conflict for many years, but the security situation has improved in recent years.
If you are planning on hiking or trekking in Kashmir, be sure to hire a guide. The mountains can be dangerous, and it is important to have someone who knows the area well.
Be sure to try some of the local Kashmiri cuisine. It is delicious and unique to the region.
I hope this helps you plan your exploratory trip to Kashmir!
